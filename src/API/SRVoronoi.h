/*
    Base class for Sphere Reducers which use the Voronoi diagram

    NOTE : when using numSpheresPerNode we only count spheres which cover the surface 
           points in SurfaceRep.  This means that merge etc will start with this number.
           this means that 5-10 times the destination number of spheres should be more
           than enough.
