/*
    Sphere Reducer which expands the medial spheres out until they only the required number
    are needed.


    NOTE : when using numSpheresPerNode we only count spheres which cover the surface 
           points in SurfaceRep.  This means that we will start with this number.
           This means that 5-10 times the destination number of spheres should be more
           than enough.


    tryIter == 0 for no iteration
    tryIter == 1 for full iteration
    tryIter == 2 for early end
