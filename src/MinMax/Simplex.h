Multidimensional minimization of the function funk(x) where x[0..ndim-1] is a vector in ndim
dimensions, by the downhill simplex method of Nelder and Mead. The matrix 
p[0..ndim][0..ndim-1] is input. Its ndim+1 rows are ndim-dimensional vectors which are the 
vertices of the starting simplex. Also input is the vector y[0..ndim], whose components 
must be pre-initialized to the values of funk evaluated at the ndim+1 vertices (rows) of p; 
and ftol the fractional convergence tolerance to be achieved in the function value (n.b.!). 
On output, p and y will have been reset to ndim+1 new points all within ftol of a minimum 
function value, and nfunk gives the number of function evaluations taken.
